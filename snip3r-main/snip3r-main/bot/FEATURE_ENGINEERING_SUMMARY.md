- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ All existing 66 tests still pass

### Usage in Predictive Oracle

```rust
use h_5n1p3r::oracle::feature_engineering::FeatureEngineeringPipeline;

let pipeline = FeatureEngineeringPipeline::new();

// Extract features
let features = pipeline
    .extract_features(&candidate, &token_data)
    .await?;

// Extract and normalize
let normalized = pipeline
    .extract_and_normalize(&candidate, &token_data)
    .await?;

// With feature selection
let selected = pipeline
    .extract_processed(&candidate, &token_data, Some(SelectionMethod::TopK(50)))
    .await?;
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarks from Demo

- **First extraction**: 91.7 µs
- **Cached extraction**: 51.2 µs
- **Speedup**: 1.78x
- **36 features extracted** in a single pass

### Optimization Features

- LRU cache with configurable capacity
- Async operations for I/O efficiency
- Batch processing support
- Lazy evaluation where possible
- Minimal memory footprint

## Extensibility

### Adding New Features

The framework is designed for easy extension:

1. **Define in Catalog**
   ```rust
   fn register_custom_features(&mut self) {
       self.features.push(FeatureMetadata {
           id: FeatureId::new("my_feature", FeatureCategory::Custom),
           // ...
       });
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Extractor**
   ```rust
   pub struct CustomExtractor;
   
   impl FeatureExtractor for CustomExtractor {
       fn extract(&self, candidate: &PremintCandidate, 
                  token_data: &TokenData) -> Result<FeatureVector> {
           // Custom logic
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Add to Pipeline**
   ```rust
   Box::new(CustomExtractor)
   ```
