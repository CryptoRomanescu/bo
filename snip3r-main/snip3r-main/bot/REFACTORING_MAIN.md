# Main.rs Refactoring - Slim Orchestrator

## Overview

The `main.rs` file has been refactored from a 344-line monolithic file containing business logic and demo code into a clean 117-line orchestrator with zero business logic.

## Changes Summary

### 1. **Created `src/orchestrator.rs` Module**
   - `OrchestratorConfig`: Configuration structure for the entire system
   - `ChannelFactory`: Factory pattern for creating all communication channels
   - `ShutdownCoordinator`: Manages graceful shutdown of all components
   - `SystemInitializer`: Helper methods for initializing the three pillars

### 2. **Extracted Demo Logic**
   - Moved all demo code to `examples/demo_full_system.rs`
   - Demo includes complete system initialization with all three pillars
   - Demonstrates OODA loop, hot-swapping, and market regime detection

### 3. **Configuration Support**
   - Added TOML configuration file support
   - Created `config.toml.template` as a starting point
   - Config includes:
     - Database path
     - RPC endpoint settings
     - Component intervals (monitoring, analysis, etc.)
     - Logging level
     - Channel buffer sizes

### 4. **Simplified main.rs**
   - **Total lines**: 117 (down from 344, 66% reduction)
   - **Non-blank, non-comment lines**: 99
   - **Business logic**: 0 (pure orchestration)
   - Responsibilities:
     - Load configuration
     - Initialize logging
     - Create channels via factory
     - Initialize components via SystemInitializer
     - Start all components
     - Handle graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C

## Architecture

```
main.rs (117 lines)
├── Load config (from file or defaults)
├── Initialize logging
├── Create channels (via ChannelFactory)
├── Initialize Pillar I (DecisionLedger + TransactionMonitor)
├── Initialize Pillar II (PerformanceMonitor + StrategyOptimizer)
├── Initialize Pillar III (MarketRegimeDetector)
├── Initialize PredictiveOracle (with hot-swap)
├── Start all components
└── Wait for shutdown signal

orchestrator.rs
├── OrchestratorConfig (TOML serializable)
├── ChannelFactory (creates typed channel sets)
├── ShutdownCoordinator (manages task handles)
└── SystemInitializer (helper for component init)

examples/demo_full_system.rs
└── Full demo with decision recording and OODA loop
```

## Usage

### Running the Main System
```bash
# Without config file (uses defaults)
cargo run

# With config file
cp config.toml.template config.toml
# Edit config.toml as needed
cargo run
```

### Running the Demo
```bash
cargo run --example demo_full_system
```

## Configuration Example

```toml
database_path = "decisions.db"
rpc_url = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
wallet_pubkey = "11111111111111111111111111111112"
rpc_timeout_secs = 30
channel_buffer_size = 100
log_level = "info"

[perf_monitor]
analysis_interval_minutes = 15
lookback_hours = 24

[tx_monitor]
check_interval_ms = 1000

[regime_detector]
analysis_interval_secs = 60
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

- [x] `main.rs` < 150 lines (117 lines)
- [x] Zero business logic in main (pure orchestration)
- [x] All tests passing (19/19 tests pass)
- [x] Graceful shutdown implemented (ShutdownCoordinator)
- [x] Config file support (TOML via OrchestratorConfig)
- [x] Channel creation in factory (ChannelFactory)
- [x] Demo logic extracted (examples/demo_full_system.rs)

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass:
```bash
cargo test
```

Test results:
- integration_test: 1 passed
- test_metacognition: 6 passed
- test_metacognition_integration: 4 passed
- test_monitoring_queue: 5 passed
- test_normalized_storage: 1 passed
- test_on_chain_verification: 2 passed

**Total: 19 tests passing**

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability**: Business logic isolated from main orchestration
3. **Configurability**: Easy to adjust system parameters via config file
4. **Extensibility**: Adding new components follows established pattern
5. **Readability**: Main entry point is now concise and clear
6. **Reusability**: Components can be initialized independently

## Migration Notes

- Old `main.rs` functionality preserved in `examples/demo_full_system.rs`
- No breaking changes to public API
- All component initialization moved to `SystemInitializer`
- Channel creation standardized through `ChannelFactory`
